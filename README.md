# DATA ANALYSIS
## Topic: *Crowdfunding* {: style="color: #333333;"}<p>This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to uncover hidden trends and provide insights into the factors that contribute to their success or failure.</p>

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel

## Features
- Conditional Formatting: Applied to the outcome and percent funded columns.
- Column Creation: New columns for percent funded, average donation, parent category, sub-category, date created conversion, and date ended conversion.
- Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts: Analyzing campaigns' outcomes per category and sub-category.
- Pivot Tables and Line Graphs: Visualizing outcomes based on launch date.
- Crowdfunding Goal Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between goal amounts and project outcomes.
- Statistical Analysis: Summary statistics for the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

## Methodology
The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualization using Excel functions, pivot tables, and charts. The dataset was analyzed to identify trends in the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns based on factors such as category, sub-category, launch date, and goal amount.

## Conclusions
Three main conclusions can be drawn from the data:

1. Certain categories and sub-categories have higher success rates compared to others.
2. The launch date of a campaign plays a significant role in its outcome.
3. There is a relationship between the goal amount and the chances of success, failure, or cancellation.

## Limitations
The dataset has a limited size (1,000 samples) and might not be representative of the entire population of crowdfunding campaigns. Additionally, it lacks information on some potentially relevant factors, such as the quality of the project's presentation, the extent of marketing efforts, or the background of the project creators.

## Further Development
To enhance the analysis and extract more insights, future work could involve:

- Expanding the dataset to include more samples and additional features.
- Employing more advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, to predict project outcomes.
- Investigating the impact of other factors, such as project duration or the involvement of influential individuals, on the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns.
